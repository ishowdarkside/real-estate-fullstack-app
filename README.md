# Real Estate Fullstack App
Full-stack application for renting and buying real estate

The web app isn't that mobile-friendly...I may work on it, soon.

Hosted Website: https://ajdin-real-estate.onrender.com/
( Wait a few minutes before it loads a website, due to free hosting constraints)

Technologies used: 
- React
- MongoDB
- Express
- Node.js

Features of the application:
- Authentication and Authorization (Login & Register with JWT)
- Register / Login as a User or Agency
- Observe all real estate on the map ( with a beautiful modal, once you click on the building icon)
- Search for real estate with search input
- Filtering real estate by price, type of post (selling or renting), type of real estate (house/apartment), and location.
- Inspecting specific post
- Inspecting  users/agencies  all active posts and successfully sold real estate.
- Rate user/agency
- Create a post (MOST PROVIDE ALL FIELDS, AND SELECT WHERE IS YOUR BUILDING LOCATED ON THE MAP)
- Delete a Post
- Finish selling - Post is sorted as successfully sold real estate.
